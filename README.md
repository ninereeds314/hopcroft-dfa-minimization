I claim no rights to this document - as it's publically available already, I'm
making this cleaned-up version available to anyone who has difficulting reading
the scan of the original. Any errors in the cleanup are, of course, my fault.

The main document is in LaTeX format. It should build on any TeX distribution
(TeTeX, MikTeX etc) using the following commands...

    latex main.tex
    latex main.tex
    dvipdfm main.dvi

The text files are the Algol listing. The decluttered version has line numbers
and page headers etc removed.
